## Overview  
This project develops a SARIMA-based (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) sales forecasting model. The model improves forecasting accuracy through hyperparameter tuning and ensures stationarity using the **Dickey-Fuller test**.  

## Features  
- Uses **SARIMA** for time-series forecasting  
- Performs **Dickey-Fuller test** to check stationarity  
- Implements **hyperparameter tuning** for better model accuracy  
- Visualizes trends, seasonality, and residuals  

## Dataset  
The model requires a time-series dataset of sales data. The dataset should include historical sales records with timestamps to capture trends and seasonality.  

## Dependencies  
Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed before running the notebook
